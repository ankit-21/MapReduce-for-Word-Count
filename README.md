# MapReduce-for-Word-Count
Performing MapReduce for word count of a text file
This notebook demonstrates how to perform MapReduce for obtaining a word count from a text document. 
In this task, the text document was split into two: the first containing 5000 lines and the second containing the rest of the lines. Two Mappers and two Reducers were intentionally created for two partitions of the text document.
